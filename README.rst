----------------------------------------
Asynchronous cache refreshing for Django
----------------------------------------

What does this library do?
--------------------------

It's an extensible caching library that refreshes stale cache items
asynchronously using a Celery_ or rq_ task (utilizing django-rq). The key
idea being that it's better to serve a stale item (and populate the cache
asynchronously) than block the response process in order to populate the cache
synchronously.

.. _rq: http://python-rq.org/

Using this library, you can rework your views so that all reads are from
cache - which can be a significant performance boost.

A corollary of this technique is that cache hammering can be handled simply and
elegantly, avoiding sudden surges of expensive reads when a cached item becomes stale.
